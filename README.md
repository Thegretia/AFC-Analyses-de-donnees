# Correspondence Analysis (CA) Project

This project applies a **Correspondence Analysis (CA)** on a business dataset called *"Financial Sample"* in order to identify relationships and correspondences between two qualitative variables; in our case *market segment* (segment) et *country* (country).

## What is Correspondence Analysis (CA)?

Correspondence Analysis is an **exploratory statistical** method used to analyze the structure of a contingency table.
It aims to **graphically represent the relationships between rows and columns** of a qualitative dataset by reducing its dimensionality while preserving as much information as possible. 

## Project Objectives 

- Understand *the distribution of segments* across different *countries* in the company’s sales data.
- Compute *row and column profiles*, their *inertias*, and *contributions*.
- Graphically represent the *factorial axes* to interpret the proximities and oppositions between categories.
- Implement the method both in Excel and in Python (using library).

## Tools Used
Python version: 3.8.5

Libraries:pandas, numpy, matplotlib
